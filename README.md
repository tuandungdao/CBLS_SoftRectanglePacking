# CBLS_SoftRectanglePacking

**Astract.**
I investigate how to partition a rectangular region of length L1 and height L2 into n rectangles of given areas (a1, . . . , an) using two-stage guillotine cuts, so as to minimize either (i) the largest perimeter, or (ii) the maximum aspect ratio of the rectangles. These problems play an important role in the ongoing Vietnamese land allocation reform. I propose constraint-based local search (CBLS) for solving the NP-hard problems. I install and implement algorithms to compare with the experiment result of science paper. Experimental analyses are conducted to compare the solution approaches in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality.
